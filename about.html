              <p>
                I'm a woman born in 1996 on a small island in Denmark. I live in
                Wynberg, Cape Town in a townhouse with my partner. I'm an
                academic particularly interested in the African continent. I've
                specialized in gender-based violence in South Africa, and hope
                to combine my passion for social justice with my
                multimediadesign journey. Read below for more information about
                me.

                    <li>
                      Currently studying Multimediadesign at The IBA

                    <li>
                      Master of Arts in African Studies from University of
                      Copenhagen. An interdisciplinary program covering
                      politics, religion, development, nature, economics,
                      culture, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Bachelor in Global Humanities from Roskilde University. An
                      interdisciplinary program based on four dimensions:
                      science & philosophy, text & sign, subjectivity &
                      learning, history & culture. I did a subject combination
                      of cultural encounters and social psychology.

                    <li>
                      Central traits: Detail-oriented, perfectionistic, curious,
                      analytical, empathetic, sociable, bubbly

                    <li>
                      16 Personalities type: Protagonist (ENFJ-T). This result
                      indicates that my personality combines charisma, empathy,
                      and idealism, giving me a natural ability to inspire and
                      lead others. I am highly attuned to people's feelings and
                      motivations, and an effective communicator. Some of my
                      greatest struggles are that my idealistic nature sometimes
                      can lead to disapointment, and my empathy can also be a
                      challenge, as I take on others’ problems as they were my
                      own.

                      I like designing things that are fun, vibrant, warm,
                      memorable and not necessarily fitting into the usual
                      minimalistic paradigm

                    <li>
                      I love photography, mostly in nature, and enjoy
                      experimenting with natural frames, textures, colors and
                      lighting.

                      I am a nostalgic at heart, and like to draw inspiration
